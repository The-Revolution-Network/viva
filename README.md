There are currently four (5) repositories. This is the top-level for the project, but there is a Docker repo that contains this one as well if you are deploying it on a server.

Clone this recursively and open the project in Visual Studio.

If you're working on the app or otherwise deploying it manually, this is the repo for you.
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:The-Revolution-Network/viva.git viva.TheRevolutionNetwork
```

If you're planning on deploying a server, here is the top-most container which builds an ASP.Net official container.
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:The-Revolution-Network/viva.git TheRevolutionNetwork.docker
```
